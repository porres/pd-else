#X text 374 561 Interpolation can add noise artifacts. To reduce this
error you can work with files with higher sample rates than Pd is running
\, such as 88.2 KHz sound file when running at 44.1 Khz as in this
example., f 50;
#X text 374 636 You can use a good resampling software to upsample
a sound file as was done here for this example., f 50;

#X text 36 212 In this example we use [phasor~] to read from [tabread4~].
The [phasor~] object is used to play the sample in a loop \, and we
need to find the frequency corresponding to the sound file's period.
We do that by dividing the sample rate of the file (even if it's different
than Pd's) by the number of samples - both information are given by
[sample~] (one could use [soundfiler] instead \, in which [sample~]
is based on)., f 61;

#X text 36 150 These objects also allow you to play files with a different
sample rate than Pd is running \, because since you can play the file
at different speeds \, you can also compensate the difference in speed.
, f 61;
#X text 35 24 If you want to play a sound file at different speeds
\, you need objects that perform interpolation such as the native [tabread4~]
object or [table~] from ELSE., f 61;
#X text 36 74 With them you can then set any reading speed (such as
1.5x) which means the reading point will fall in between samples \,
hence you need to interpolate to get a value that better corresponds
to that missing step n between. We'll see the interpolation type of
[tabread4~] a bit later., f 61;
#X text 515 74 We use a ratio value to set the speed \, this can also
be calculated from cents or a percentage value. Then \, all you need
is to multiply the ratio by the frequency in hertz. Note that negative
percentage/ratio values are possible and that they play the file backwards.
