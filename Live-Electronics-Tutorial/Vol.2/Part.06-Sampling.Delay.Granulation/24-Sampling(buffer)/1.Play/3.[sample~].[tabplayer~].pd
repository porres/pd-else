#X text 86 462 The [tabplayer~] object from ELSE is also a much more
powerful alternative to [tabplay~] and also offers multi-channel support.
Check its help file., f 27;
#X text 68 172 Below \, it's loading a single channel file (the same
as last example). Its outlet also outputs the table size in samples
(the output is actually a list with size \, sample rate and number
of channels) \, so we have basically the same thing as the last example.

#X text 68 61 The [sample~] object from the ELSE library is a convenient
abstraction based on [soundfiler] that can load a sample into an internal
table. It can also be used to create an audio buffer that you can record
into as we'll show later in this section of the tutorial. One advantage
of [sample~] is that it can be used to load multi channel files. Check
its help file for more details.;
