#X text 314 135 The [vco.m~] is a MERDA module that combines different oscillators. So far these modules have only been presented without being a properly used in a patch. We'll get to that., f 37;
#X text 315 220 This is a more complex module than the others we've seen before and is also a more complex oscillators with features and things that haven't been addressed yet in this tutorial \, but we'll get to all of it., f 37;
#X text 315 317 You can choose from basic waveforms and PWM sets pulse width for 'square' and 'vsaw'. The pitch input is in MIDI and we have modulation input for frequency \, phase \, pulse width (we'll see all of this later) and the sync input which takes impulses and can be set to 'Soft Sync' with the toggle., f 37;
