#X text 756 183 A more straightforward conversion:, f 22;
#X text 594 403 MIDI pitch;
#X text 594 464 Frequency;
#X text 593 337 Semitones;
#X text 509 60 Let's consider a reference pitch of middle C (C4) to 0 volts and use a CV value of -5v to 5v to transpose this pitch. This means it goes down 5 octaves and up 5 octaves \, so the range is from C-1 to C9. In MIDI \, this is from 0 to 120! Now let's consider the -1 to 1 digital signal as the -5v to +5V range. The patch below makes such a conversion., f 61;
#X text 593 204 -1 to 1;
#X text 593 269 Volts (-5 to 5);
#X text 578 370 reference (Middle C);
#X text 765 350 or...;
#X text 532 505 The above is some sort of conversion from "CV" to MIDI \, let's look a bit more into it in the next example. You may also realize that V/oct (Vots per octave) is a measure of octaves and relates to values in cents. Since "1" is an octave it has 1200 cents and you can convert cents to V/oct by dividing by 1200!;
#X text 22 24 A "CV" control depends on a voltage range used by a given module \, but there’s no single standard for this. You can have +/- 5v as a usual standard for AC (alternate current) \, also called ‘bipolar’ signal \, but unipolar standards also exist \, with different possible values \, such as from 0 to +5v \, 0 to +8v and 0 to +10v., f 65;
#X text 22 107 A safe bet is that you’ll never see a control voltage signal lower than -10 volts or higher than +10 volts and that’s because of the limitations of the power supply standard. Trigger and gate/pulses jump from 0 to a positive extreme \, so modules will usually respond to impulse/gate values of +5v. What a given CV controls in terms of absolute values is always dependant on the module itself. This is quite different than in Pd where you can use a signal with a very specific value like '100' to control the attack phase of an envelope in ms. If you’re using CV to control the attack value of a module you have to tune it by ear \, and usually you have a knob in the module to set the amount of CV that is controlling the parameter., f 65;
#X text 22 396 The audible signal range in Pure Data is composed of amplitude values from -1 to 1 and we can use it to send CV to analog gear. Conversely \, Pd can receive CV from an external source in this -1 to 1 range. You usually need special hardware to calibrate digital audio to a CV range \, so you can \, for instance \, use audio from Pd to control a modular system \, which may use a -5V to +5V range \, or a 0V to +10V instead (both of which are very common)., f 65;
#X text 22 286 When it comes to control the frequency of an oscillator \, there’s also no standard and no way to know what a specific voltage value represents in terms of frequency. You usually calibrate and have a knob to tune your oscillator at a reference voltage value. The only golden rule and standard is that a change of 1 volt is a shift in one octave. Hence \, it is call "Volt per Octave" \, where 0.5 is half an octave (a tritone) \, 2V is two octaves and so on., f 65;
#X text 22 506 The peak to peak amplitude in both common cases is "10" \, which means you can have 10 octaves. This is more than good enough. The piano has 8 octaves \, for instance. If you start at 20 Hz \, you have 20.48 Khz 10 octaves above \, so it even exceedes a bit the ideal audible range of humans. The MIDI range \, by the way \, has a range of 10 octaves plus a 5th (from 0 to 127)., f 65;
